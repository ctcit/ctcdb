# CTC Database
This application provides a web interface to manage the CTC member database, as well as providing a REST API for the trip report, GPX archive and and hut booking systems.

It uses the [CodeIgniter 4 Framework](https://codeigniter.com/).

### Rest API tests

This tests are intended to be run using the VSCode "REST Client" plugin. They aren't
really tests per-se - just useful API commands that can be executed to check the response
is as expected.
