<h1>New member data entry form</h1>

This form should not be used when adding a new couple. Please use the separate
<i>New couple</i> menu command for that.
<p>
Fill in at least the new member's name, loginName and address and click submit. The 'dateJoined' field is the date
at which the member was approved by committee, in DD-MM-YYYY format. If left blank, the current date is used.
